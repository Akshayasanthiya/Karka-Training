# Simple Python program to understand the ternary operator    
# cust_age = 40          # here, we are declaring a variable to store the customer age  
# Here, we are using the Ternary operator to check discount eligibility    
# cust_discount = "Eligible for Discount" if cust_age >= 60 else "Not Eligible for Discount"    
# Here, we are printing the result after performing the ternary operator    
# print(cust_discount)   

a = 330
